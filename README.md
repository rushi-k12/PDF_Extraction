# PDF Extraction and Text Categorization Project

This project demonstrates how to extract text from a PDF file and categorize the text into predefined categories. The extracted and categorized text is then saved into a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `fpdf` for generating PDF files
- `PyPDF2` for extracting text from PDF files
- `pandas` for handling data and saving it to CSV

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install fpdf PyPDF2 pandas
